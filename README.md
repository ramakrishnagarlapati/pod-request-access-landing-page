### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"
